% This function computes a set of statistical metrics to evaluate the 
% differences between measured and estimated signals for a given electrode.
%
% Input Arguments:
% - `pot_measured`: A vector representing the measured signal from an MEA electrode.
% - `pot_estimated`: A vector representing the estimated signal for the same electrode.
%
% Output:
% - `metrics`:A row vector where each column corresponds to one of the 
%   following seven metrics:
%   1. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the average magnitude of error.
%   2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of squared differences between signals.
%   3. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute differences between signals.
%   4. **Standard Deviation (Measured)**: Standard deviation of the measured signal.
%   5. **Standard Deviation (Estimated)**: Standard deviation of the estimated signal.
%   6. **Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the linear relationship between the signals.
%   7. **Mean Relative Error (MRE)**: Average relative error between measured and estimated signals.
%
% Notes:
% - Each metric is stored in its respective column in the `metrics` vector.
% - Correlation is calculated using the `corr2` function.
% - Ensure `pot_measured` and `pot_estimated` are vectors of equal length.
