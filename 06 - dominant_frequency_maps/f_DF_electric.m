    % Description:
    %   This function computes the dominant frequency of electric signal data
    %   using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach. 
    %   The dominant frequency is the frequency component with the highest 
    %   amplitude in the given signal. It can be useful in various applications, 
    %   such as analyzing cardiac signals or other electric signal data.
    %
    % Syntax:
    %   [MFFTi, Sffti, fstep] = f_DF_electric(DATA, fs, freq_up, freq_down)
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   - DATA: A matrix containing the input data, where each row represents a different signal.
    %   - fs: The sampling frequency of the data.
    %   - freq_up: The upper frequency limit for dominant frequency estimation.
    %   - freq_down: The lower frequency limit for dominant frequency estimation.
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   - MFFTi: An array containing the estimated dominant frequencies for each input signal.
    %   - Sffti: A matrix of spectral information, where each row corresponds to an input signal.
    %   - fstep: The frequency step used in the FFT.
    %
    % Example Usage:
    %   [MFFTi, Sffti, fstep] = f_DF_electric(DATA, fs, 8, 3.5);
    %
    % Notes:
    %   - The function applies a Hamming window to the input signal and performs zero-padding to improve frequency resolution.
    %   - The dominant frequency is estimated within the specified frequency range [freq_down, freq_up].
    %   - The function returns an array of estimated dominant frequencies for each input signal. If no dominant frequency is found within the specified range, the value will be set to 0.
