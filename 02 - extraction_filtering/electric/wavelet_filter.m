%
% This function performs wavelet filtering by decomposition and reconstruction on signals.
% Different wavelet types and sets of reconstruction levels can be applied.
% It decomposes each signal using the specified wavelet type and number of levels,
% and then reconstructs the signal using the selected reconstruction levels.
% Optionally, it can save the MRA matrices for each electrode. 
% 
%
% Usage:
%   wavelet_filter(D_EL, fs, electrodes, waveletTypes, numLevels, reconstructionLevelsSets, saveMRA)
%
% Inputs:
%   - D_EL: Raw signals, being each row an electrode and each column one sample.
%   - fs: Sampling frequency of the signals.
%   - electrodes: Vector containing the electrode numbers, can be one or more.
%   - waveletTypes: Cell array of strings containing the wavelet types to be used.
%   - numLevels: Number of decomposition levels.
%   - reconstructionLevelsSets: Cell array of vectors specifying which levels will be used for reconstruction.
%   - saveMRA (optional): Boolean indicating whether to save the MRA matrices (decomposition levels variables). Default is false.
%                         If the goal is only filtering, leave this parameter empty.
%
% Outputs:
%     - It returns the variable data_filtered containing the filtered signals.
%     - Reconstructed signals named according to the wavelet type, set of reconstruction levels,
%     and the suffix "_Reconstructed". For example, "Signal_reconstructed_db4_Levels_1_5".
%     - If saveMRA is true, the function creates MRA matrices and stores them as variables
%     in the workspace. The variables are named according to the electrode, wavelet type,
%     set of reconstruction levels, and the suffix "_MRA". For example, "MRA_db4_Levels_1_5_Electrode_1".

% This function performs wavelet decomposition and reconstruction on signals
% from electrodes using different wavelet types and sets of reconstruction levels.
% It decomposes each signal using the specified wavelet type and number of levels,
% and then reconstructs the signal using the selected reconstruction levels.
% Optionally, it can save the MRA matrices for each electrode and configuration.
%
% Example:
%   wavelet_filter(D_EL, 3600, [1:16], {'db4', 'coif1'}, 10, {[6,7], [7,8,9]});
%
% This example performs wavelet decomposition and reconstruction on signals from
% electrodes 1 to 16 using 'db4' and 'coif1' wavelet types, 10 decomposition levels,
% and using two sets of reconstruction levels: [6,7] and [7,8,9].
